If I had more time I would have loved to improve the UI more. I would have liked to improve filtering to in addition to search sort by different columns. It would have been good to create pagination instead of returning all advocates at once. I would also like to add some actual tests instead of testing it myself as I go and have more error handling than there currently is. Another thing I can think of is I would love to add more indexing and faster searches because that would be helpful for a large database. There are many more things I would improve but these are the ones that have come to mind currently.

I enjoyed this coding assignment.
Thank You!
