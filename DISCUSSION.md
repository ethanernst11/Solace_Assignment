The things that I was able to complete were that I was able to get the webpage up and running after changing some configurations and adding a file index.js in db/seed/ in order to insert the seed data. I then made sure that I could use the .env variable for the database so I am not committing a database URL. I fixed the outstanding errors once the webpage loaded up. 

Once I got the webpage working I decided that I wanted to improve the UI a little bit. I made everything a little bit more separated and made the look a little better. I also made sure to make the text larger than I originally planned because I remembered that Solace currently helps elderly people most before commercial insurance so you have to make the platform very easy to use and easy to read.

I also decided that one of the performance enhancements I would make is to make the search filtering go through SQL in the database instead of through TypeScript to help with scaling and speed.

If I had more time I would have loved to improve the UI more. I would have liked to improve filtering to in addition to search sort by different columns. It would have been good to create pagination instead of returning all advocates at once. I would also like to add some actual tests instead of testing it myself as I go and have more error handling than there currently is. Another thing I can think of is I would love to add more indexing and faster searches because that would be helpful for a large database. There are many more things I would improve but these are the ones that have come to mind currently.

I enjoyed this coding assignment.
Thank You!
